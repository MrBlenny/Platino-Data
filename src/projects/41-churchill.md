Capturing an idyllic vista over the tranquil waters of Middle Harbour, this masterstroke of contemporary design is one of an exclusive pair of dual storey residences. Spanning 470sqm on title and with plans featuring an internal lift, the layout has been conceived to offer a variety of living areas with a solid connection to surrounding terraces and private landscaped gardens.
