‘Azure’ has been designed to ensure that it will be the most exclusive apartment building North of the Harbour. 

No effort or expense has been spared to ensure that it will do justice to its unique location at the finest harbourside address in Milsons Point. Apartments feature semi-enclosed wintergardens and interiors are defined by the widest range of the very best local and imported finishes, natural materials and appointments. Rich American Oak parquetry timbers and cool composite quartz tile floors under foot traverse a series of interconnecting architectural spaces and immaculately presented kitchens, bathrooms and en-suites.
