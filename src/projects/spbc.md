Sydney Park Business Centre was designed to satisfy the requirements of creative users for a business centre for like minded businesses. It has embraced the “adaptive redevelopment” ethos, preserving the character and features of this remarkable Art Deco building. The soaring ceilings and saw-toothed roof have been maintained, allowing abundant natural light and an open, spacious ambience to the business suites.
