A 1930â€™s factory has been converted into apartments and courtyard houses which retain and reflect the industrial character of the area. Platino, the multi-award winning architectural firm has created a sparkling series of spaces for living, working and entertaining.

Sunlight floods in to the interiors which are light and airy and surprisingly private. Landscaped courtyards, covered balconies intimate cosy interiors, timber floors, soaring ceilings and floating mezzanines lie within. The project was constructed by Pimas Gale builders and received the 2008 award for Excellence in Housing.
